										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It is with great regret that we have decided to cancel this year’s Doctrine of Christian Discovery (DoCD) conference “Christian Domination and the Failure of ‘Truth and Reconciliation.’” It has been rescheduled for 22-23 August 2020. Of course we will fully refund everyone who has registered for the conference.</p>
<p>As all of you know, our sponsoring organizations—the Indigenous Values Initiative (IVI) and the American Indian Law Alliance (AILA)—are deeply involved with the work of revealing and dismantling the DoCD and we do not want this cancelation to slow any of the momentum that has been built around this issue over the last few years. However, our small volunteer organizations have been involved in some new and exciting directions that require our undivided attention over the next few months. This week we all decided that missing one year of the DoCD conference was unavoidable and that this postponement would not be too disruptive.</p>
<p>In recognition of the 100 year anniversary of the Women’s right to vote, one of our initiatives for 2020 is to focus on the Haudenosaunee influence on the Women’s Suffrage Movement (following Sally Roesch Wagner’s work and new book on the topic). Our 2020 DoCD conference will likely focus on Women and their roles in traditional matrilineal societies and how that has been systematically disrupted by religion. If you have other ideas on this topic or others we would like to hear them.</p>
<p>We will be refunding you the ticket amount here shortly. Unfortuantely we are unable to refund the eventbrite.com fee.</p>
<p>Instead we would like to offer you the following options to covery the eventbrite processing fee:</p>
<p>A coupon to the Indigenous Values store.<br />
A check for the processing fee amount mailed to you. if you would like us to do that please email i&#110;&#102;o&#64;ind&#105;&#103;&#101;&#110;o&#117;&#115;&#118;a&#108;ues.org and give us your mailing address</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience with us and, again, we are sorry to miss seeing you all again this year.</p>
<p>Phil, Betty, Sandy, Gail, Joe and Adam</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">A conference in Onondaga Nation Territory, at Syracuse University and Skä·noñh—Great Law of Peace Center</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday and Sunday, 17-18 August 2019.</p>
<h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
<p>This conference continues discussions between religious communities and Indigenous Peoples about the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (DOCD) so that real healing can occur. “Truth and Reconciliation” efforts in settler-colonial states have the appearance of resolving the history of conquest and domination but often do not result in a healing of Indigenous Peoples and their lands. Using words like reconciliation, repudiation, domination, discovery, conquest, missionization, colonialism and settler-colonialism, or referring to Indigenous Peoples in the singular or as populations, issues or groups, has consequences. Noam Chomsky, George Lakoff, and Steven Newcomb remind us that word choice matters and, although these concepts appear benign, they actually perpetuate and give cover to a violent past. The DOCD continues to be a matter of urgent concern for Indigenous Peoples around the world. It has emboldened trans-national corporations to further their extraction practices everywhere forcing standoffs and migration of Indigenous Peoples. Our lineup of speakers will address international migration issues and the connection between the DOCD and the destruction of Mother Earth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to <a href="http://www.mainewabanakireach.org/_taking_on_the_doctrine_of_discovery_what_are_our_next_steps">Maine-Wabanaki REACH</a> Board Member Diane Oltarzewski for this exaging post event write up for &#8220;<a href="https://indigenousvalues.org/taking-on-the-doctrine-of-discovery-what-are-our-next-steps/">Taking on the Doctrine of Discovery: What are our next steps</a>?&#8221; Here is a brief highlight from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>And then the panel discussions began! Everyone present was there to grapple with what action is needed to effect real change. I heard many wise voices new to me: Freida Jean Jacques (Onondaga) Turtle Clan Mother, speaking against racism and about the Good Mind. Steven Newcomb (Shawnee/Lenape), who has analyzed the cognitive and Biblical underpinnings of conquest and domination carried out in North America to subjugate originally free and independent Indigenous Nations. His book Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery is eye-opening and a must-read. Tupac Enrique Acosta (Aztec), who asked &#8220;When did light divide into white and less-than-white?&#8221; Joe Heath (Onondaga) Legal Counsel, who documented examples of how the Doctrine of Christian Discovery has become encoded in U.S. law over the centuries, differentiating between Native &#8220;occupancy&#8221; (a lesser claim) and the &#8220;absolute title&#8221; conferred by so-called discovery. Jake Edwards (Onondaga) who said: &#8220;Colonizers are in deep trouble because they don&#8217;t recognize their broken heart&#8230;we have to put our minds together if we want change to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>A water ceremony was held on the shore of the terminally polluted Lake Onondaga &#8211; I&#8217;d brought a little jar of water from the Passagassawakeag River to mingle with other waters from many sources, joining in a healing prayer.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, before the Skä·noñh—Great Law of Peace Center had officially opened, we held a first conference titled “The Doctrine of Discovery: After Repudiation, What Next?”  About 40 delegates from different faith traditions attended.  This year’s conference builds on the 2014 meeting.  The Skä·noñh Center is now open and it is a good context from which to draw the values of the Haudenosaunee to affect positive change.  As with the previous meeting, we will first to learn about the devastating impacts of the Doctrine of Discovery first hand from the Haudenosaunee, to understand its history, and then to share strategies for addressing this 500+ year-old ongoing human rights violation.  Then we will hear from one another and the ways in which religious and faith communities are pushing back against the Doctrine of Discovery.  There will be a traditional foods banquet on the evening of Saturday the 18<sup>th</sup> followed by screening of the film “<em>Spirit Game: Pride of a Nation</em>” and panel discussion.</p>
<p>There are a limited number of scholarships available to cover the registration fee.</p>

I want to begin by acknowledging the original peoples of these territories, the Lenape Peoples. My own people, the Haudenosaunee also had influence on these territories&#8211;and we still do today.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="hasCaption"><span class="text_exposed_show">I want to thank all the members of the NYC Mayoral Advisory Commission on City Art, Monuments, and Markers. I want to acknowledge my Mohawk sister Dr. Audra Simpson, as well as Dr. John Tchen, Executive Director of NYU’s Asian/Pacific/American Institute, and Associate Professor at NYU, who has hosted many Indigenous events at the A/P/A Institute.<br />
</span></span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="hasCaption"><span class="text_exposed_show">The U.S. system of land title is rooted in centuries old documents from the Vatican&#8211;the Catholic Church, known as papal bulls. Collectively, they are known as the ‘Doctrine of Discovery.’ The first papal bull (an edict from the Pope similar to a Presidential Order) of the Doctrine is titled “Terra Nullius,” (1095 AD) and states that any land in which Christians do not live is declared “empty” and open to conquest. These papal bulls gave Europeans the justification to “invade, conquer, fight, subjugate” Indigenous Peoples around the world. While these documents were written centuries ago, the U.S. Supreme Court has cited the Doctrine of Discovery to deny land rights to the Oneida Nation as recently as 2005 AD. This is not history. Claims that Columbus was simply a man from the past, out of step with today’s values ignoring the fact that this is ongoing. This is not in the past.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="hasCaption"><span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
Continuing to celebrate Columbus, and leaving monuments of him up is the continued act of erasure to ensure that “Americans” will never be educated on the reality of our harsh shared history. The Papal Bulls set forth a mindset and perception that Indigenous Peoples such as myself were not human therefore not equal to all other peoples.<br />
The statues depicting Columbus ignore his enslavement and massacre of Indigenous Peoples, and the promotion of sex slavery of children, as young as 9 years old. These are NOT merely a ‘difference of opinion,’ these are historical facts and they are taken directly from Columbus&#8217; own diary entries and journals. This is not someone worthy of a monument or of celebration.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="hasCaption"><span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
Columbus began the imposition of the Doctrine of Discovery, which supposedly granted European settlers sovereignty over non-Christian lands “discovered” by their explorers. That continues to provide the legal underpinning of the denial of land rights to our Indigenous Peoples. Columbus set off the genocide of our peoples. Columbus also opened the way for the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="hasCaption"><span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
It is easier for ” Americans” to continue the belief that the “Americas,” known to us as Turtle Island, was uninhabited then to face the realities of genocide, attacks on the environment, the stealing of our lands and the enslavement of our peoples and those brought here to be enslaved.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="hasCaption"><span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
We are not asking for reconciliation as it is not possible to reconcile all that has been done but you can make a conscientious choice to do the right thing as these unspeakable horrors and many more are not deserving of celebration. We are asking the monuments of Columbus be moved to a museum, where they can be placed in accurate historical context for future generations to learn from. These monuments to hate must come down now!</span></span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doctrine of Christian Discovery: After Repudiation, What Next?</strong></p>
<p>Saturday<br />
24 May 2014<br />
Skä·noñh—Great Law of Peace Center (formerly St. Marie Among the Iroquois), Onondaga Lake Park</p>
<p>6680 Onondaga Lake Parkway, Liverpool, NY 13088</p>
<p>Conference description:</p>
<p>From initial contact over 520 years ago, Indigenous leaders have brought into discussion the insidious role that Christianity has played in colonization and environmental destruction. Over the last several decades the Doctrine of Christian Discovery has been seen not only in historical and contemporary subjugation of indigenous human rights and land rights, but also in the ongoing devastation of the environment we all share.</p>
<p>We seek to bring together people who have worked on addressing and repudiating this doctrine so that we might learn from each other and develop strategies for moving forward with this work. How can we use the momentum from repudiation to change the colonial paradigms that drive decisions in our settler society? What are core issues that will benefit from alliances between Indigenous Peoples and Faith-Based Communities? What have we learned about people and what impacts our understanding?</p>
<p>Co-sponsors include: Onondaga Nation, Neighbors of the Onondaga Nation, Religion Department @ Syracuse University, Onondaga Historical Association, Loretto Community (Denver, CO), New York Yearly Meeting (Quaker) Indian Affairs Committee, NYS Committee on Native American Ministries of the United Methodist Church, Zen Center of Syracuse, All Saints Catholic Parish.</p>
<p>$30 REGISTRATION INCLUDES MEALS DURING THE CONFERENCE</p>
